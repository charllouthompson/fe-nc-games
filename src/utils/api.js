/*
- list of all reviews : get api/reviews
- view page for each category with a list of reviews : get api/reviews?category=:category
- view individual review : get api/reviews/:review_id
- view a reviewâ€™s comments : get api/reviews/:review_id/comments
- votes on a review and see change immediately : patch api/reviews/:review_id and set inc_votes as one on body, plus in useEffect have change of votes in the re-render array
- post comment to review : post api/reviews/:review_id/comments with a default user in the body of post request but comment should be received from user input
- Sort reviews by created_at, comment_count, votes : get api/reviews?sort_by=:PARAMETER, will need a different request and component for each
- delete my comments : delete api/comments/:comment_id, but need to only give the option to delete if username matches the default user, 
Maybe do this from the get reviews by review ID page
